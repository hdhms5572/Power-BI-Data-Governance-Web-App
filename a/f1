Problem Statement
As organizations increasingly adopt Power BI for reporting and analytics across multiple workspaces, ensuring effective governance becomes a significant challenge. Manually tracking the status of reports, datasets, and user activities is time-consuming, fragmented, and error-prone.

Key governance issues include:

Difficulty identifying outdated or unused reports and datasets

Limited visibility into user engagement and access rights

Inefficient resource utilization due to inactive assets

Lack of centralized oversight across multiple workspaces

Increased risk of data governance failures and compliance issues

This dashboard was developed to address these challenges by offering a centralized, automated, and interactive platform for monitoring and managing Power BI workspace usage.
