Dover Data & Analytics
Summer Internship 2025 Plan
Expectations
•	As summer interns, you’re expected to actively contribute to building a streamlined web app using Python, BI tools, and Streamlit.
•	You'll collaborate closely to translate data governance needs into actionable insights and intuitive visualizations.
•	This experience will help you develop technical, analytical, and communication skills in a real-world BI environment.
•	At the end of your internship, you will present your results to the Dover Data & Analytics team. More details will be shared during your internship. 
Values and soft skills to be evaluated
•	Curiosity & Initiative: Proactively ask questions, seek to understand the "why" behind tasks, and explore beyond assigned work.
•	Collaboration & Communication: Work well with others, share ideas clearly, and ask for help or feedback when needed.
•	Creativity & Problem-Solving: Propose new approaches or features and think critically when faced with challenges.
Project Focus: Power BI Data Governance Web App
Key Areas of Insight:
•	Active vs. inactive users
•	Most/least used reports and datasets
•	Dataset refresh patterns and failures
•	Orphaned or outdated content
•	Usage trends by OpCo (Operations Companies)
•	Admin/ownership gaps
 
Week 1: Onboarding & Setup (June 9–13)
Goals:
•	Learn Streamlit basics: learn how to display titles, dataframes, and simple charts. 
•	Get familiar with key datasets and governance concepts (e.g., usage metrics, metadata).
•	Get familiar with Dover Power BI Data Governance data and relevant insights for our team. 
Tasks (both interns):
•	Install tools: Anaconda and Power BI Desktop. https://www.anaconda.com/download and https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494 
•	Join meeting: Receive and study a sample Python script to make basic REST API calls (e.g., get users, workspaces)
•	Read and implement the following documentation: https://medium.com/@chaitanyasirivuri/building-your-first-streamlit-app-a-step-by-step-tutorial-e058d5dfe5f4 

Week 2: Data Exploration & API Integration (June 16–20)
Goals:
•	Build a prototype of a web app showing real business data. Not relevant to show insights yet. Make sure you are capable to build a Streamlit app with real time data. One page with a couple sample tables and graphs will be sufficient. 
Tasks (both interns):
•	Collaborate together to present one integrated app.
Tasks for Haridass (App Dev):
•	Create an initial app layout with sidebars and placeholders for charts/tables.
•	Implement sample API calls in Streamlit (e.g., list all users, list of all workspaces, list of all semantic model, list of all reports, etc.).
Tasks for Nandhitha (BI Tools):
•	Begin cleaning and structuring API response data for BI use.
•	First list of Power BI assets categorized as active/inactive.
•	Create couple visualizations. 

Week 3: Research and Integrations (June 23–27)
Goals:
•	Build a prototype that is capable to implement Row Level Security and embed a Power BI report.
•	Research. Expectations are for you to come up with solutions and proposals. 
Tasks for Haridass (App Dev):
•	Create different pages for user activity, dataset usage, and most accessed reports.
•	Explore and research Row Level Security on a Streamlit App. For example, users who use the app from OpCo ABC are not able to see OpCo XYZ data.
Tasks for Nandhitha (BI Tools):
•	Identify and calculate top used assets (reports/datasets) per OpCo.
•	Explore and research how to embed a Power BI dashboard into a Streamlit App.

Week 4: Efficiency and Replication (June 30–July 4)
Goals
•	A solid Streamlit applications is already built. Expectation is to present first app Demo to relevant team members and receive feedback.
•	Prepare and present your first Demo.
Tasks for Haridass (App Dev):
•	Think about efficiency. How much time your API calls are taking. How much resources are you consuming. Optimize your app and show actions implemented.
Tasks for Nandhitha (BI Tools):
•	Replicate relevant PBI dashboard visualizations using Python visualizations. (Feel free to propose new ways of visualizations).
